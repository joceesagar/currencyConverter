# Currency Converter

This is a **Currency Converter** web application built using modern web technologies like **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **React**. The app fetches real-time currency conversion rates using **Axios** to handle API requests. Animations are powered by **Framer Motion**, and **Radix UI** is used for building accessible and customizable UI components.

## Features

- Convert between various currencies using real-time exchange rates.
- Responsive design for both mobile and desktop views.
- Smooth animations and transitions using Framer Motion.
- Accessible and customizable UI elements with Radix UI.
- Lightweight and performant, thanks to Next.js and TypeScript.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript to enhance code quality and reduce runtime errors.
- **React**: Front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for handling API requests.
- **Framer Motion**: For creating smooth animations and transitions in the app.
- **Radix UI**: Accessible and unstyled UI components for building the user interface.
